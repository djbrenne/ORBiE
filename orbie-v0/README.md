Properly, ORBiE is more a noophyte than a robot&mdash;at least at the time of this writing.

> **noophyte** *(n.) (NEW-ah-fite):* a form of life whose origin is thought; an idea; a story; a memory; a plan.

# ORBiE v0

Orbie v0 will be the first robot instantiation of ORBiE. This version of their body, software, and firmware will have some, but not all of the features that ORBiE may eventually have (depicted in the above image). 

## Feature List

| Feature | ORBiE v0 | ORBiE |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Two cute flippers, actuated for flapping | ✅ | ✅ |
| A cute round head with embedded interaction sensor | ✅ | ✅ |
| RGB LED animated eyes glowing softly through the face | ✅ | ✅ |
| Self-balancing in upright position under perturbations | ✅ | ✅ |

| Inherently safe for unanticipated interaction modes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Continuously learning, with persistent memory between power cycles | ❓| ✅ |

*As mentioned above, this README.md was drafted before construction. Inevitably, time constraints will render some of these features infeasible for v0.*
