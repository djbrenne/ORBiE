# ORBiE

ORBiE is an **O**ttonomous **R**obot **Born** **i**n **E**dmonton. Pronouns he/she/they.

Properly, ORBiE is more a noophyte than a robot&mdash;at least at the time of this writing.

> **noophyte** *(n.) (NEW-ah-fite):* a form of life whose origin is thought; an idea; a story; a memory; a plan.

# ORBiE v0

Orbie v0 will be the first robot instantiation of ORBiE. It (ORBiE's body, software, and firmware are objects referred to with the non-personal pronoun "it") will have some, but not all of the capabilities that ORBiE may eventually have (depicted in the above image). 

## Feature List

| Ability to hop up stairs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Independent charge sequence initiation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Battery charge level indication | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vision | ❌ | ✅ |
| Audition | ❌ | ✅ |
| Proprioception | ❌ | ✅ |


*As implied above, this README.md was drafted before construction. Inevitably, time constraints will render some of these planned features infeasible for v0.*

## Abilities

ORBiE v0 is only able to provide ORBiE sensory data through its onboard magnetometer. Its head conceals a satisfyingly tactile button, allowing humans to provide reward signals corresponding with the duration of a head-pat. A rapid double-click of the button communicates a yes/no query. ORBiE will be expected to respond to queries by raising their right flipper for "yes", their left flipper for "no", or both flippers to shrug for "I don't know". The v0 arms ad/abduct independently on a 1 DOF shoulder through a range of approximately 120 degrees. A single LED lights and animates both eyes synchronously, enabling blinks but not winks. Optionally, RGB color modulation may be enabled, allowing additional information channels for debugging or communication. The v0's low centre-of-mass and rounded base provide inherent stability and SHM-based expressivity in the manner of a Weeble.

## ORBiE's Participation in "RoadBot" (2025)

Beginning at the Edmonton International Airport on the morning of Tuesday August 19 2025, and returning there on the evening of Thursday August 21, I (Dylan) intend to perform the Event Score described in my road-bot repository README.md, with ORBiE as my Collaborating Robot. ORBiE will participate through their ORBiE v0 incarnation, providing occasional unprompted suggestions for directions and answers to simple yes/no queries.
